# âœ¨ Sparkle: An Overview

**This is the programming language found in the AP Computer Science Exam Reference Sheet, except it's actually a language you can code in!**

For example, varibles can be assigned with:
```
a <- [value] OR a <-- [value]
```

Here's how you can assign variables to other varibles
```
a <-- 10
b <-- 10
c <-- 0 + a
a <-- b
b <-- c
```
